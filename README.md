    <h1>Age Calculator</h1>
    <p>An age calculator is a simple web application that calculates a person's age based on their birthdate. Here's an overview of how it typically works:</p>

 <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Input:</strong> The user provides their birthdate using an input field. This can be done in various formats, but the most common is through a date picker or text input.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> When the user clicks a "Calculate Age" button or triggers an event, JavaScript code within the application calculates the age. It typically follows these steps:
            <ul>
                <li>Get the current date.</li>
                <li>Get the birthdate provided by the user.</li>
                <li>Calculate the difference between the current date and the birthdate in years, months, and days.</li>
                <li>Display the calculated age.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> The result, which is the person's age, is displayed to the user on the web page. It is presented in years, months, and days.</li>
    </ol>
