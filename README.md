        <h1>Age Calculator</h1>
        <p> An age calculator is a simple web application that calculates a person's age based on their birthdate. Here's an overview of how it typically works:

1. **Input**: The user provides their birthdate using an input field. This can be done in various formats, but the most common is through a date picker or text input.<br>

2. **Calculation**: When the user clicks a "Calculate Age" button or triggers an event, JavaScript code within the application calculates the age. It typically follows these steps:<br>
   
   - Get the current date.
   - Get the birthdate provided by the user.
   - Calculate the difference between the current date and the birthdate in years, months, and days.
   - Display the calculated age.<br>

3. **Output**: The result, which is the person's age, is displayed to the user on the web page. It is presented in years, months, and days .</p>
